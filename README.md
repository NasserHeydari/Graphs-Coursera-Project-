This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”.

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.
